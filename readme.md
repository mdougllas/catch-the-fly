This is the first project for IronHack bootcamp.<br>
The project is a simple game based on The Ghostbusters movie.<br>
The game is score-based, so the goal is to hit the most ghosts you can.<br>
You start with 15 bullets and 30 seconds. On each 10th hit you get to the next level and earn more bullets and time.<br>
On each new level, the ghost's speed is increased.<br>
